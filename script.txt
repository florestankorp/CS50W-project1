Hello everybody

This is Florestan, coming to you from the Netherlands!
This video goes alongside the second assignment for Harvard's CS50W: Introduction to Web Programming with Python and Javascript

In this assignment I was asked to make a book review application using Flask, a Python micro-framework that helps with RESTful handling of data, application routing and template binding for rendering data from two sources:

The Gooodreads API, where API stands for Application Programming interface, which is basically a service they provide that can be called to retreive information.

Goodreads is a social cataloging website that allows individuals to search freely its database of books, annotations, and reviews. For this assignment I am interested mainly in the reviews.

The second source of data I use in this app comes from a Postgres database hosted on Heroku. Postgres or PostgreSQL is a free and open-source relational database management system and I hosted mine on Heroku, a cloud based platform as a service provider.
